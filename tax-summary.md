## 1. Tax Filing and Payment Rules

### Due Dates by Entity Type

| Entity Type | Form | Original Due Date | Extended Due Date |
|-------------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Individual | 1040 | April 15 | October 15 |
| C-Corporation | 1120 | April 15 | October 15 |
| S-Corporation | 1120-S | March 15 | September 15 |
| Partnership | 1065 | March 15 | September 15 |
| Estate/Trust | 1041 | April 15 | September 30 |
| Tax-Exempt | 990 | 15th day of 5th month | 6-month extension |

### Critical Rule: Extension vs. Payment

> **The extension to FILE is NOT an extension to PAY.**

- Filing an extension (Form 4868) extends the filing deadline by 6 months
- **Payment is still due on the original due date (April 15)**
- If you cannot pay by the due date, you should still file the extension and pay as much as possible
- Interest and failure-to-pay penalty will accrue on any unpaid balance from the original due date

### Weekend/Holiday Rule

When a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday:
- The due date moves to the **next business day**
- This applies to both filing and payment deadlines
- Example: If April 15 falls on Saturday, the due date is Monday, April 17

### Timely Filing Determination

A return is considered timely filed if:

| Method | Timely If... |
|--------|--------------|
| U.S. Mail | Postmarked by due date (Mailbox Rule) |
| Private Delivery | Received by due date (no mailbox rule for most carriers) |
| E-File | Transmitted by midnight (taxpayer's time zone) on due date |
| Hand Delivery | Delivered to IRS by close of business on due date |

**Designated Private Delivery Services (PDS)** that qualify for the mailbox rule:
- DHL Express
- FedEx (various services)
- UPS (various services)

## 2. Penalty Calculations

### Failure to File Penalty (FTF)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Rate** | 5% of unpaid tax per month or partial month |
| **Maximum** | 25% of unpaid tax (5 months) |
| **Minimum** | If filed 60+ days late: Lesser of $510 or 100% of tax due |
| **Starts** | Day after due date |
| **Ends** | When return is filed |

**Example Calculation:**
- Tax owed: $10,000
- Filed 3 months late
- FTF Penalty: $10,000 × 5% × 3 = $1,500

### Failure to Pay Penalty (FTP)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Rate** | 0.5% of unpaid tax per month or partial month |
| **Maximum** | 25% of unpaid tax (50 months) |
| **Rate Increase** | Increases to 1% per month after levy notice issued |
| **Rate Reduction** | Reduces to 0.25% if in approved installment agreement |
| **Starts** | Day after due date |
| **Ends** | When tax is fully paid |

**Example Calculation:**
- Tax owed: $10,000
- Paid 6 months late
- FTP Penalty: $10,000 × 0.5% × 6 = $300

### Combined Penalty Scenario

When **both FTF and FTP apply in the same month**:
- FTF is reduced from 5% to **4.5%**
- Combined rate: 4.5% + 0.5% = **5% per month**
- This reduction applies for months 1-5 only

**Maximum Combined Penalties:**
| Period | FTF | FTP | Total |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|
| Months 1-5 | 22.5% (4.5% × 5) | 2.5% (0.5% × 5) | 25% |
| Months 6-50 | N/A | 22.5% (0.5% × 45) | 22.5% |
| **TOTAL** | **22.5%** | **25%** | **47.5%** |

### Accuracy-Related Penalty

| Type | Rate | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| Negligence | 20% | Careless disregard of rules |
| Substantial Understatement | 20% | Understatement exceeds greater of 10% of correct tax or $5,000 |
| Substantial Valuation Misstatement | 20% | Value/basis claimed is 150% or more of correct amount |
| Gross Valuation Misstatement | 40% | Value/basis claimed is 200% or more of correct amount |

### Civil Fraud Penalty

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Rate** | 75% of underpayment due to fraud |
| **Burden of Proof** | IRS must prove fraud by clear and convincing evidence |
| **Interaction** | Replaces accuracy-related penalty (does not stack) |
| **Statute of Limitations** | Unlimited assessment period |

### Interest on Underpayments

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Rate** | Federal short-term rate + 3% |
| **Compounding** | Daily |
| **Starts** | Original due date (regardless of extension) |
| **Non-Deductible** | Interest on personal tax liability is NOT deductible |

---

## 3. Statute of Limitations

### Assessment Statute of Limitations (ASED)

The IRS has a limited time to assess additional tax:

| Scenario | Assessment Period | Key Points |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Normal Return** | 3 years | From later of due date or filing date |
| **Substantial Omission (>25%)** | 6 years | Omitted gross income exceeds 25% of reported gross income |
| **Fraud** | Unlimited | Any fraudulent return with intent to evade |
| **No Return Filed** | Unlimited | IRS can assess at any time |
| **Basis Overstatement (>25%)** | 6 years | Overstated basis resulting in >25% omission |

### How to Calculate the 3-Year Period

**General Rule:** SOL runs from the LATER of:
1. The original due date of the return, OR
2. The actual filing date

**Examples:**

| Scenario | Due Date | Filed | SOL Starts | SOL Expires |
|----------|----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Timely filed | Apr 15, 2024 | Apr 10, 2024 | Apr 15, 2024 | Apr 15, 2027 |
| Late filed | Apr 15, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2024 | Jun 30, 2027 |
| Extended & timely | Oct 15, 2024 | Oct 1, 2024 | Oct 15, 2024 | Oct 15, 2027 |

### Substantial Omission (6-Year Rule)

The 6-year period applies when:

**For Income Tax Returns:**
- Omitted gross income exceeds **25%** of gross income stated on return
- Calculation: Omitted Income ÷ Reported Gross Income > 25%

**Example:**
- Reported gross income: $100,000
- Actual gross income: $140,000
- Omission: $40,000
- Test: $40,000 ÷ $100,000 = 40% > 25% → **6-year SOL applies**

### Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Period** | 10 years from date of assessment |
| **Effect** | After CSED, IRS can no longer collect the debt |
| **Lien** | Federal tax lien self-releases after CSED |

### Events That Suspend the CSED

The 10-year clock STOPS during:

| Event | Suspension Period |
|-------|-------------------|
| Bankruptcy | Duration + 6 months |
| Offer in Compromise pending | Duration + 30 days |
| Installment Agreement request | Duration + 30 days |
| CDP hearing | Duration of hearing process |
| Taxpayer outside U.S. | Duration if absent 6+ months |
| Collection lawsuit | Duration of litigation |
| Innocent spouse claim | Duration + 60 days |

### Refund Statute of Limitations

To claim a refund, taxpayer must file within the **LATER** of:
1. **3 years** from the date the original return was filed, OR
2. **2 years** from the date the tax was paid

**Refund Limitation Rule:**
- If claiming within 3-year period: Refund limited to tax paid within 3 years + extensions
- If claiming within 2-year period (but after 3-year period): Refund limited to tax paid within 2 years

## 4. IRS Collection Process

### Notice Sequence Timeline

| Notice | Name | Timing | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| **CP14** | Balance Due | ~5 weeks after filing | First notice of balance owed |
| **CP501** | Reminder | ~5 weeks after CP14 | First reminder |
| **CP503** | Urgent | ~5 weeks after CP501 | Second reminder |
| **CP504** | Intent to Seize | ~5 weeks after CP503 | Intent to levy state refund |
| **Letter 1058/LT11** | Final Notice | Before levy | Final notice with CDP rights |

### How Collection Begins

1. **Assessment** - IRS determines tax is owed (self-assessed on return or IRS audit)
2. **Notice and Demand** - IRS sends notice demanding payment (typically CP14)
3. **10 Days** - Taxpayer has 10 days to pay after notice and demand
4. **Statutory Lien** - Federal tax lien automatically arises after failure to pay

### What Happens If You Don't Respond

```
Week 0:    CP14 sent - Balance due notice
Week 5:    CP501 sent - First reminder
Week 10:   CP503 sent - Second reminder  
Week 15:   CP504 sent - Intent to seize state refund
Week 20+:  Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be filed
Week 25+:  Final Notice (Letter 1058/LT11) - 30-day CDP rights
Week 29+:  Levy/garnishment can begin
```

### Enforced Collection Actions

After the notice sequence, IRS may take:

| Action | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Federal Tax Lien** | Legal claim against all property | Automatic after assessment + notice + non-payment |
| **Notice of Federal Tax Lien** | Public filing | IRS discretion |
| **Levy** | Seizure of property/wages/bank accounts | 30-day notice required |
| **Seizure** | Physical taking of property | Court approval for principal residence |

---

## 5. Federal Tax Liens

### How a Lien Arises

A federal tax lien arises **automatically** when:
1. A tax is **assessed**
2. The IRS sends **notice and demand** for payment
3. The taxpayer **neglects or refuses** to pay within 10 days

**Note:** The lien exists even without public filing. Filing a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) makes it public.

### Effect of Federal Tax Lien

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Attaches to all property** | Real estate, personal property, financial assets |
| **Includes after-acquired property** | Property acquired after lien arises |
| **Affects credit** | When NFTL filed, credit bureaus are notified |
| **Priority** | Generally junior to prior recorded liens |
| **Prevents sale/refinance** | Title companies require lien satisfaction |

### Types of Lien Actions

| Action | Form | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Lien Arises** | N/A | Automatic statutory lien |
| **Notice of Lien (NFTL)** | 668(Y) | Public notice filed with county/state |
| **Lien Release** | 668(Z) | Lien extinguished - debt paid or CSED expired |
| **Lien Discharge** | N/A | Specific property released from lien |
| **Lien Subordination** | N/A | Another creditor given priority |
| **Lien Withdrawal** | 668(W) | NFTL removed from public record |

### When Liens Are Released

The IRS **must** release a lien within 30 days when:
- The liability is **fully satisfied** (paid in full)
- The liability becomes **legally unenforceable** (CSED expires)
- A **bond** is accepted
- The liability is **compromised** (accepted OIC)

### Lien Withdrawal vs. Release

| Lien Release | Lien Withdrawal |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Lien no longer exists | Lien still exists, but NFTL removed from record |
| Debt is satisfied or unenforceable | IRS agrees public notice not needed |
| Automatic when conditions met | Discretionary by IRS |
| Form 668(Z) | Form 668(W) |
